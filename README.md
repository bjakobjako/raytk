# RayTK

RayTK is a library of TouchDesigner components that construct raymarching shaders (and other types of shaders) using networks of COMPs the TouchDesigner network editor.

RayTK consists of a set of operator (ROP) components, and a set of tools for working with them.

## Getting Started

### Download the Library

The first step to using RayTK is to download the latest tox file, from the [repository](https://github.com/t3kt/raytk/releases).

Note that there are many of files in the repository itself, but these are only needed for development purposes. If you only want to *use* the library rather than *modify* it, use the release tox file.
