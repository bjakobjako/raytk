# Editor Tools

RayTK's editor tools are a set of actions that can be performed on selected operators.

They're available in a menu that can be opened with the shortcut `alt+shift+r`, as long as the main toolkit tox is loaded in the project.

The set of tools shown in the menu depends on what is selected in the network. For example, when a [`raymarchRender3D`](/raytk/reference/operators/output/raymarchRender3D) is selected, the menu will include options to add a camera or a light.
