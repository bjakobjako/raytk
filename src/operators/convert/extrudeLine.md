Extrudes a 2D SDF cross-section into a 3D volume, like the extrude operator, but between two points.

The extrude operator goes along a selected axis, with a height center on the origin. Instead of doing that, this operator extrudes so that one side is centered at Point1 and the other end at Point2.

## Parameters

* `Point1`
* `Point2`

## Inputs

* `crossSection`: 2D SDF cross-section to extrude.
* `point1Field`: 
* `point2Field`: 

## Variables

* `axispos`: 
* `normoffset`:
