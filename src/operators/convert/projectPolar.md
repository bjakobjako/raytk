## Parameters

* `Axis`
  * `x`
  * `y`
  * `z`
* `Projection`
  * `spherical`: Wrap space around a sphere. X goes around the axis, Y goes around the sphere perpendicular to X, and Z goes from 0 at the center to 1 at the radius.
  * `cylindrical`: Wrap space around a cylinder. X goes around the axis, Y goes from 0 at the bottom (-height/2) to

* `Radius`
* `Thickness`
* `Height`
