Woven yarn pattern.

Note that this pattern has a lot of fine detail which does not work well for things like offsetting SDF surfaces, unless the Texture Amount is set to 0.

## Parameters

* `Translate`: Moves the entire pattern.
* `Size`: Scales the pattern.
* `Texamount`: Amount of roughness in the pattern.
* `Texdensity`: Tightness of the roughness.

## Inputs

* `coordField`: Field that produces vectors that the pattern uses as coordinates instead of regular spatial position. Only the X and Y parts are used.
