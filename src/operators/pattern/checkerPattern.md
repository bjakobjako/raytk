Checkerboard pattern with alternating black and white rectangles.

This pattern produces just float values not colors. To apply color to it, pass it into a `colorRampField`.

## Parameters

* `Translate`: Moves the entire pattern.
* `Size`: Scales the pattern.

## Inputs

* `coordField`: Field that produces vectors that the pattern uses as coordinates instead of regular spatial position. Only the X and Y parts are used.
