Switches between several inputs, without the need to rebuild the shader, allowing for fast switching.

Note that inputs that are not connected are skipped over when assigning numbers to them, so if inputs 1, 2, and 4 are connected, they will use indices 0, 1, 2.

## Parameters

* `Enable`
* `Source`: When 0, the first source is used, 1 for the second, etc.

## Inputs

* `definition_in_1`: 
* `definition_in_2`: 
* `definition_in_3`: 
* `definition_in_4`:
