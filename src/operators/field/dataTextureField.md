Accesses data from a texture with the same layout as the renderer.

This is designed to be used with pointMapRender to load in precomputed data that follows the same pixel layout as the coordinate map, or with cameraRemap to use a UV map to change where each pixel's ray starts.

## Parameters

* `Texture`
* `Returntype`
  * `float`
  * `vec4`
