# Function operators

Function operators are an advanced type of operator used to control the behavior of other types of operators.

They are similar to field operators, but rather than providing values based on positions in space, they take in and modify simple numeric values.

For example, they can be used to control the curve used to smooth the blending region of a magnet operator, with either a sudden edge, or various types of smoothed transitions.
