SDF for a 2d vesica, which is a shape based on the overlap between two circles.

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesica_piscis) for details.
See [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtVfRW) for an example.

## Parameters

* `Radius`: The radius of each circle.
* `Distance`: The distance between the circles. Higher values will produce thinner shapes since the circles will overlap less. Lower values will produce rounder shapes, eventually reaching a full circle when the distance is 0.
