Radial arc, a segment of a circular path, with rounded ends.

## Parameters

* `Orientation`: Angle of the center of the arc in degrees.
* `Aperture`: Range of the arc in degrees.
* `Radius`: Radius of the circle which the arc is taken from.
* `Thickness`: Thickness of the arc.

## Inputs

* `orientationField`: Field used to offset the orientation angle, in degrees.
* `apertureField`: Field used to override the aperture angle, in degrees.
* `radiusField`: Field used to multiply the circle radius.
* `thicknessField`: Field used to multiply the thickness of the arc.

## Variables

* `normangle`: Angle from one end of the arc to the other, normalized to a 0..1 range.
