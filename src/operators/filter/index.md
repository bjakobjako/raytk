# Filter operators

Operators that take an input and modify it.

Many of these are spatial transformations (scale, rotate, translate), which
alter the coordinates that are used by their input operator.

Many of these can be used for various types of return types (SDFs,
float/vector fields, etc). Some only support a limited set of return types.
