SDF for a squared mobius ring, which is like a rectangular bar twisted and then bent into a ring.

## Parameters

* `Translate`: Moves the center of the ring.
* `Radius`: The radius of the ring as a whole.
* `Thickness`: The thickness of the ring.
* `Rounding`: The amount of rounding applied to the edges of the ring.
* `Twist`: The number of times to twist the ring. Fractional numbers will create a discontinuity in the ring where it starts/ends.
* `Twistphase`: Shift applied to the twisting of the ring.
* `Axis`
  * `x`
  * `y`
  * `z`

## Inputs

* `thickness_field_definition_in`:  Value field that can be used to vary the thickness of the ring.
* `radius_field_definition_in`:  Value field that can be used to vary the radius of the ring.
