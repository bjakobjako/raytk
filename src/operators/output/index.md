# Output operators

Outputs are a special category of operator that takes in one or more
chains of OPs, generate a shader, and run it to produce some sort of
output.

The most common one is `raymarchRender3d`, which takes in a chain of OPs
that produces an SDF in 3D space, and applies raymarching to render an
image.
