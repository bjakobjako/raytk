A material element that produces the shading level for the surface.

The shading level will be 1 in areas without a shadow, and 0 in areas that are fully in shadow.

## Parameters

* `Usecolor`: Whether to multiply the shading level by a color, producing a vector field instead of just the shading level.
* `Color`
* `Invert`: Inverts the shading level, so that 1 is for full shadow and 0 is for no shadow.
