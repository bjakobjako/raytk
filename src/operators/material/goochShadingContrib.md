A material element that uses the Gooch shading model.

It produces colors that are based on the surface normal. It is useful for showing the 3D structure of a shape rather than using realistic lighting-based color.

See [Gooch Shading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gooch_shading).

This is equivalent to the `goochMat`, for use in a modular material.
